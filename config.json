    "explanation": "Degenerate activities were restricted by attendance at horse races or visits to Las Vegas but are now available on our phones 24 hours a day. That gambling impulse in every one of us had friction between thought and action, now that friction has disappeared. Draft Kings let’s you bet on any sporting event, Caesars Palace App let’s you visit a Casino virtually, Polymarket let’s you bet on elections online, crypto exchanges let you pick up NFTs and memecoins in seconds, and lotto.com has us picking numbers and checking out with our credit cards.",
