It's a great question. I mean, we are always reevaluating every time we have new tax rates discussed at the state level or regulations come up at the federal level, on how we can further push parlay mix onto our customers. The states are expecting tax revenue, and they are finally realizing that isn\u2019t the reality. So, we must figure out a way to trick shareholders and analysts like yourself into believing that we can actually turn a profit once more and more states try to get to a 51% tax rate like New York. If we can continue to purchase apps like Jackpocket, that might help distract everyone for the time being. That\u2019s why we had @GazipuraMo  start the rumor about the merger of Rush Street. And then, I\u2019m sorry what was the second part of the question? Regulations. So, regulations, yeah, that\u2019s a good question. If we get regulated more, again, we\u2019ll just hope to push more parlay mix and that\u2019s definitely something that we're exploring, because what else can we do? But we don't put hope in the guide.",
